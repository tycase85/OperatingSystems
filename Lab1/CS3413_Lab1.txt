1. This is a parent process: 17823  VAR:-1 
This is a child process: 17824  VAR:1 

2. The received IDs are randomized each time however they child process comes 1 place after the parent thread. The incrementing variable does not increment and decremement properly since the fork() makes a clone and they now use a different local variable for var.
